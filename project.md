## Introduction 

Here is a summary description of the topic. Here is the problem. This is why the problem is important.

- Rainfall forecasting important for these reasons: extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, rain- and snow-storms) often create dire situations (e.g., floods, landslides, and wildfires) causing severe economic losses and casualties. As global warming continues, the
frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are likely to increase in many regions (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2022GL097904) 
  
- Machine learning approach important for these reasons: existing models use complex statistical models that are often too costly, both computationally and budgetary, or are not applied to downstream applications (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266682702100102X)
  
- SGP hot spot for land-atmosphere interactions: Numerous studies have addressed the effect of soil moisture on
subsequent rainfall, yet consensus remains elusive (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018GL078598) 

There is some dataset that we can use to help solve this problem. This allows a machine learning approach. This is how I will solve the problem using supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement/etc. machine learning.

We did this to solve the problem. We concluded that...

## Data

Here is an overview of the dataset, how it was obtained and the preprocessing steps taken, with some plots!

- I used three products from the  U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (DOE ARM) Southern Great Plain (SGP) central facility (CF) and the region within a 50-km radius of the CF for the period of 2001-2019. The data is publically available at this website: https://www.arm.gov/data/. 

1) Product 1: SONDEWNPN
Description: Radiosonde balloon observations to obtain atmospheric surface variables. The variables of interest in this study were temperature, humidity, pressure and dewpoint.

2) Product 2: Oklahoma Mesonet Soil Moisture (OKMSOIL)
Description: Soil moisture measured by soil moisture sensors. The variable of interest in this study was fractional water index (FWI).

3) Product 3: Arkansas-Red Basin River Forecast Center (ABRFC)
Description: hourly gridded precipitation based on WSR-88D Nexrad radar precipitation estimates combined with rain gauge reports with extensive quality control (Fulton et al., 1998)


The preprocessing steps involved filtering each product such that I only extracted warm season (May - September) days between 2001-2019. I also colocated each product so that the soundings, precipitation and soil moisture files all exist within a 50km range of the ARM SGP Central Facility site. For every file in each product, I replaced missing data with NAN values and filtered all files such that I only kept the files that did not contain an excessive amount of missing information. For the precipitation product, I calculated an "afternoon precipitation event" (APE) as days in which afternoon precipitation was i) greater than morning and evening precipitation and ii) at least twice as much precipitation occurred in the afternoon than the morning. Below displays the code that calculated APEs:

```python
pdf_time_ranges['APE'] = (pdf_time_ranges['precip_14_20'] > pdf_time_ranges['precip_6_13']) & \
                (pdf_time_ranges['precip_14_20'] > pdf_time_ranges['precip_21_24']) & \
                (pdf_time_ranges['precip_14_20'] > 2 * pdf_time_ranges['precip_6_13'])

pdf = pdf_time_ranges[['date','APE']]
```

Once each product was preprocessed and saved within its own dataframe, I joined all soundings, precipitation and soil moisture into one result dataframe. Since my result dataframe still contained arrays of atmospheric variables from the soundings (variables measured at interpolated pressure levels up to ~200hpa in the atmosphere), I extracted only the surface conditions. Finally, I plotted histograms, box plots and correlation heatmap of each feature in order to get a sense of the distributions of these variables. Figures 1 and 2 show the existence of ouliers within the feature variables. However, I chose to not remove them out of a scarcity of data. Figure 3 that q and dp are highly correlated. To remove the correlations in the model, I dropped q and kept dp.

## Modelling

Here are some more details about the machine learning approach, and why this was deemed appropriate for the dataset. 

The model might involve optimizing some quantity. You can include snippets of code if it is helpful to explain things.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
X, y = make_classification(n_features=4, random_state=0)
clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
clf.fit(X, y)
clf.predict([[0, 0, 0, 0]])
```

This is how the method was developed.
