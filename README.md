Precipitation is a vital resource for daily human consumption, agricultural needs and industrial applications (Chen et al., 2022). Consequently, predicting the timing and amount of precipitation in specific regions is crucial for the development and maintenance of efficient infrastructure. Additionally, extreme weather events involving precipitation, such as hurricanes, rain and snow storms pose significant threats to infrastructure, human lives, and may lead to profound economic losses (Chen et al., 2022). Given the potential amplification of extreme events due to climate change in some places, accurate short-term and long-term rainfall forecasting becomes increasingly important for the management of infrastructure, economic resilience and the protection of human life.

Traditionally, short-term rainfall predictions have relied upon numerical weather forecasting methods. However, numerical weather forecasting has posed challenges to accurate prediction such as large model uncertainties and extreme computational demands (Chen et al., 2022). Machine learning models are a useful alternative to conventional models for a few reasons. First, machine learning models offer a relatively inexpensive computational solution to prediction. Second, many models have the advantage of properly handling complex nonlinear relationships from historical data (Mao et al., 2020). Given the inherently nonlinear nature of precipitation processes, machine learning models present an opportunity to improve predictive precipitation capabilities.

The Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of the United States is a location strongly influenced by land-atmosphere interactions particularly during the warm season months (May - September) (Myoung and NielsenGammon et al., 2010). However, the extent to which precipitation is influenced by soil moisture is not well understood (Welty et al., 2018). This study seeks to measure the relative importance of land-surface versus atmospheric features in dictating the presence afternoon precipitation in the SGP. Specifically, this study is designed to:

1) Evaluate the predictive accuracy of a random forest classifier for predicting afternoon precipitation events (APEs) based on late morning atmospheric and soil moisture conditions.

2) Quantify the relative importance of soil moisture versus surface atmospheric properties in the prediction of APEs.
